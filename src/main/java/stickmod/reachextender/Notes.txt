The classes in this package are used to extend the attack reach of the player depending on which ItemStick
he or she is holding.

Minecraft sets the reach distance in two locations:
PlayerControllerMP.getBlockReachDistance()
and
C02PacketUseEntity -> NetHandlerPlayServer.processUseEntity()

This is done by replacing Minecraft.playerController (PlayerControllerMP) with a wrapped version:
getBlockReachDistance() to select an appropriate reach distance, and
attackEntity() to send a custom attack message to the server, which performs the relevant attack tasks from processUseEntity

The replacement of the vanilla Minecraft.playerController is done during WorldClient load.
